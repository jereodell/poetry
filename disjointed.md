# Disjointed

One day encompasses the world and every unmet  
desire, these by the thousands and each

for a lifetime of seeking and some found  
and yet, this gasp, this disjointed script.

Adam too, defunct: the whole narrative weeping  
in the breach. And some found, wordless

letters and in this moment, names (drunkards,  
all, of excess). Come, fetch the legend of Jamshid,

one's magic cup and swill, but for God's sake, beloved  
leave us our cover, shroud us our shame. Believe.
