# Oblivion

The desert sages say: come now what’s the risk  
of ecstasy? Quick -- morning distillations shift

a million visions of the sun and it’s gone.  
Why worry what’s hiding there in contradiction?

This devourer keeps the silage dry or the farm hands feud, or say:  
“Light?” and it’s awash in flame -- is it Allah or some unholy *pilier au feu*?

All this and are you yet speechless? Oil the wick,  
call his name, eat, drink -- be flesh, tallow, wax.

Protest all one’s life and Death works in the mirror,  
binds these pages of *Nudité* -- O son of woe, who lives forever?
