# Distance

In some triangle of connections, anxious  
dreams of love, my daughter appears

in need of my mentorâ€™s latest book of poems.  
Someone has asked me to send it to her

and I would send it to him, for his autograph, first.  
To be clear, the book would not find a reader.

A waking wind rises, ripping across the 400 miles  
times over, prairie and great lake. Raw. Break. I do miss her,

my wild mess of a child, her cheekbones and grey-brown-green eyes,  
even the strut she puts on to hide. O Lord, Lord -- I cry.
