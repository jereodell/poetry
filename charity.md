# Charity

Not the blossom of song, house of music --  
but defeat, loss, the sound of breaking.

You and your curls -- concerns,  
and for me, my longing apprehensions.

If we brag, it's deception or a heart's simple-mindedness --  
or we occupy the secrets of peacefulness.

Now that you appear -- be blessed  
in adoration, facedown this browning earth.

Now that you mention it, great gads!  
Am I poor & do you look after the afflicted?
