# Before the execution

-- above the Niagara, for Kevin T. P. Di Camillo, John Matthias, and Robert Creeley

She held out her glass eye and sd  
here it is, yer last myopic line

yer last chance at a found, she sd  
and we wuz sad or we wuz fine

young in, yer Duce mime  
my Southern feign, fine

She held out her glass eye and sd  
boys, now this here's a piece

and we wept or she gave us  
our last kerchief to mop, it did

seep, the socket where'd we sink  
to dye, we two blued it, we did

She held out her glass eye and sd  
soldiers, write me this yr ash & bits

and we wuz tried, gun sights of ire  
trued upright, rewired and unspun

the Pope's one last ball, the Puritan  
his comeuppance, the worm

She held out her glass eye and sd  
men, I takes this shot and then

enough, we'd grn, we'd gone  
over each his next ledge

gave us bred, gave us ills & broo  
and we wuz sed or we wuz find
