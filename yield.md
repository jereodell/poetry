#Yield

Youth, desire plays you, dumps you out for dice  
and, when lust commands the board, you eat & drink what's left of life.

But look, if you have eyes to see & listen, if you have ears --  
the cupbearer in her beauty is the end of all faith & reason;

the girl singing her way down the beach, robs the mind of order.  
Let night come; it will confirm this carpet of dreams.

She carries to him, in one palm, the conservatory in bloom;  
her lap yields to the florist, flowers in their season.

See, my youth, how gilt the early wine & hear how the harp bends its late allure.  
Listen, poet, in this life, admiring ... for this pulse: a new creation.
