#Yield

Youth, desire will play you, dump you out for dice  
and, will lust command the board, you'll eat & drink what's left of life.

But look, if you have eyes to see & listen, if you have ears --  
the cupbearer in her beauty is the end of all faith & reason;

the girl singing her way down the beach, robs the mind of order.  
Let night come, it will confirm this carpet of dreams.

She carries to him, in one palm, the conservatory in bloom;  
her lap yields to the florist, flowers in their season.

See, my youth, how the cupbearer glides, hear how the harp bends its allure.  
Listen, poet, in this life, admiring; for this pulse: a new creation.
