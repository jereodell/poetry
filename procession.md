# Procession

Walk about the citadels of the great city as if of the first, and what is is.  
Brick and, finally, a recent end to the labor. Landscaping freshly set and watered,

shrubs not to survive the summer and, from the bulwarks and cornerstones,  
drape banners and insignia. All a matter of course, modest even.

As for the poet, he writes of its remembered majesty, none greater, not one  
a better signifier of the eternal. The city, of course, fell in the ruins of its design,

layered over in centuries of industry, and even the poem,  
in so far as it belonged to the place, did not survive. What then of this?

Neither memorial nor gesture of grandeur; neither myth nor countenance.  
What now, but to enter the procession.
