# Dry

Don't forget who you've become, how simple,  
waiting mid-street of her daily travels

& seeing her nowhere; growing root deep,  
I dream dreams, lust lust, fit full of prayers.

Or, seeing life (by all accounts) accounted,  
I wonder what it all adds up to â€”

lips & cursing without custom; street lamps  
& a vision of a kiss at the lunar surface.  

A boy, I thought I knew clairvoyance,  
& now, even the knowledgeable bed sheets are dry.
