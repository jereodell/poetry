# Directive

Brined and pickled, a small cohort of culled cats  
are skinned and laid out on their backs under

the fluorescent light of the high school science lab.  
The lesson: death too may be stilled, damned from the quick.

Likewise, art too is formalin: four centuries on, the Guild of Surgeons  
leans in feline attention over the corpse of Aris Kindt.

Ah, and you, dear reader, stalking the line, make of this  
what you will: when the heart stops, stitch

the last breath up in a sachet of catnip; loose the plodding bulk;  
give over the chase, the mouser's paw and catch.
