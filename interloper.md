# Interloper

In my defense, I watch with unease, my daughter,  
rich in melanin, glow in a crowd of common white girls.

Point of observation: the last of spring’s gentle creatures  
wither off in silence & midfield, forward the season, the storms

simmer or blast away at lurking hope. Inscrutable, more so  
than mysterious; insociable, more so than tragic.

Closed systems; none extinct. I can feel my life’s  
disposition clench at the gut -- to be in the world & not of it.

And on the flash of her eyes, the telling. Yes! My child,  
my love, we are so far from home. Light it up & let it burn.
