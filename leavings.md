# Leavings

Winter season birds arrive to sample the decorative pond,  
newly installed beneath the service berry trees, nude.

No nearer stand of water? Plenty, ripped through  
with depravations, flips and spins a multitude of mirrors.

Risking it, the Junco flits at the water's surface to sip from an oak leaf.  
Quick, scatter now. The city raucous, the streets of asphalt,

the drudge pace of industry. Light manufactured & yet darkness everywhere.  
So it goes. But little winged hearts, greetings,  

here, find what may.  
Beasts all, meeting and forage. Lean.
