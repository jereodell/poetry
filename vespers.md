# Vespers

The prophet would lean out over the curvature of time,  
but, however gentle the yoke, love bears down in weighty accumulations.

At evening, neglect; by daybreak, task. But more so, haywire.  
The garden has grown thick with autumn weeds

and the chard, red at its heart, threads a thatch --  
papers, scraps of half-written verses pile at our feet.

Held at bay by neither romance nor the clinical gaze,  
judgment day hits the sky at noon and all is dross.

Here in Kiriath-Arba I am with Ghalib. He waits. He wishes for his death.  
Nearby, his niece and nephew sleep in the moonlight.
