# Cityscape

Nigh the death of the city, the leopard  
with dispassionate silence, hauled

the kill to the third story balcony  
of the abandoned apartment complex.

Gutted, eyeless, impatient of rot, the carcass  
waits for seasons of bird and maggot.

All about, the rain clouds buckle and yawn  
and the plazas are blown with the empty refuse of the past.

But, peering with forward eyes into an alley,  
the leopard flicks her tail & all is as will be--the hunt.
