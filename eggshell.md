# Eggshell

When I was a boy and before I could read, I found a robin’s egg pushed from a nest and left for me in the grass. I put it in the front pocket of my overalls. (It would be crushed, of course, but it was a treasure like none I’d ever seen.)

That same day or a lifetime later, how can I say, my father placed me on the back of a chestnut mare. She is and was forever and more the spirit of the horse -- the white of her eye, the flame of her tail, her thoroughbred legs in three white socks. She spooked and threw me off.

The field had been sown in red clover that year. I remember to a meter the place where I landed, the “wind knocked out,” the egg crushed on my chest. In the border of the field a wild grape with a trunk as thick as a fence post overgrew a cedar tree. And nearby, alone in the pasture, one of the last, giant ash trees offered a limb low enough to climb. 

Maybe this and the memory too is just another symptom of nostalgia--the kind that made my father the sort of person that my mother would love and also the kind that would make an ordinary place overly special--its requirements secondary to its myth, its inhabitants cut loose from the world. But when he greeted you with a smile, you would see the gold tooth at the front of his mouth before the blue of his eyes. He loved loving you and maybe that too was too much.

It’s all gone now. The egg first -- and then (I don’t remember how and when) the horse, and the field (two decades later) made way for traffic, and after another two, my father.

If I had kept a bit of that eggshell, I don’t know what I would do. But, I didn’t, so I’m writing this and giving it to you.
