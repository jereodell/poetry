# Settle

Nerve. No longer fight it. No longer lament this. Breathe a kind of peace  
against peace. So, it all begins over and over again. Break.

In a year of loss, in a season, my mother's garden  
was in full bloom the day she died. Break.

Weeded and kept artfully arranged and, so, seemingly left to its own design,  
irises and columbine, field daisies as if they'd always been there.

I hadn't seen her in five months--her body crushed by the semi that crossed the median;  
rolled over the car and left a mess no one I love should witness.

Stunned in a bright day of bloom, some kind of shock digs in and botches the mangnetic field of  
no one novel, another motherless man. Not so slowly caving in.
