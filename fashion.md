# Fashion
 
Write one rhyme, honest and true. But quick!  
Tie it to a stone, sink it Euphrates deep.
 
Call it: clemency. Call it: divagation.  
Rise, one who would so move mountains, kerplunk!
 
See. Though I am burned up enough at her pleasure,  
justly, am I not the object of dithers and taunts?
 
Write one vision, hewn in steady hand, of one  
piece, metered to the spheres. Call it: eat and read.
 
Curses too? She leaves me to fashion; she marks  
my footfalls. Blind, I'm to make my turns.
