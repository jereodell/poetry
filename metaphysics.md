# Metaphysics

A crease of light, what was life? I would not know.  
What have I done, middling through seasons overdue?

The whole body, the whole human animal  
in thick accumulation reduces

in the fire to gas and splattered fat, a mere  
six pounds of bone and ash.

Iced over, the bird bath is blown  
with the finest sugar of snow. Hair-lined,

the heavy surface of substance waits; etched, here  
in a cloud of needles, of sense, the soul would shape.
