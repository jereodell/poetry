In the winter sands of Lake Michigan a rainbow smelt  
stares back at any that stoop to look.

For all I know, it could be the last of a vanishing crop,  
its pupil a dark jewel set in silver, its fingerling body buried in grit.

The winds are too sharp today and the mist has hidden the sun.  
What gulls we have seen have kept to ground,  
waiting it out in paved lots and playgrounds.

I don’t know if they’ll return -- the gulls, the fish, the first of the earth --  
or what they have seen, these creatures of eye.

In my heavy skull I feel now the optic nerve,  
cross with itself and worn, forget whatever it can  
and still pass for here.

But, we have the beach to ourselves today for what may be our last --  
there’s no aura, no flash of light, no prophetic design to make it not so,  
this feeling of falling in, deep to the center and before there was time.
