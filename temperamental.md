#Temperamental

Did he become a friend of the king? Or else, why would he,  
Ghalib, strut through the courtyards at mid-day?

He sings: in paradise the wine flows freely  
and the musk-rose blooms in plenty --

where the heat touches the body, there the blood begins;  
where the blood flows, there the passion gathers.

But who waits now for paradise? Who, but we who find little  
to console us in that the way is straight, this harrowed footpath.

Temperamental like a flame, a flare, brief like heat lightning,  
the king's favor -- and yet, the poet carries his tambourine.
