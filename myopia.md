# Myopia

Gestures grow in importance as it sets in; a small flock of birds  
flits from bramble to shrub -- or wind fills the branches, releases and again --

an assurance of a presence, of what is unseen, there is. Beauty  
in silhouette sheds detail to memory and imagination. Possibility

so expands and seeming --  the way at dark a street-side trash bin  
becomes a bear -- the way driftwood on the opposing bank

protrudes a patch of snow or takes flight as any eagle should.  
"Whatever draws or presses another is

as much drawn or pressed by the other" --  
and there we are, in the middle of it all, dissolved.
