# J’accuse!

The catbird repeats my first name from the top of the neighbor’s rangy tree:  
Jair-ee, Jair-ee, Jair-ee.  
Where he heard it first, I do not know.  
How he managed to (at once) get it right  
and give it back with a sneer,  
I cannot say.

He means to chase me from my clutch.  
He means this hearse is neither mine nor his.  
He means what a mockery it all is.

One evening after supper he flitted down to the garden  
and perched on the rim of a flower pot.  
He just sat there and stared,  
bemused, taking my measure and waiting me out,

As if he knew what the songbirds had sung would fall like ash into silence at my feet.
