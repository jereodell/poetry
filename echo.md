# Echo

Face it: the lungs hover near the heart   
and trade one gas for another, press

the aging cage, press and ease; feel it there,  
these words, this lyric -- flushed from the blood

to spare the flesh its fouled solitude -- and here I am,  
thumbing (again) the tepid, gray nerve of devotion.

Damn it! Where is she? Feeding scorn to a thinner echo?  
Little voice, face it -- in time, exiled from the animal

and seeping from every rock, leaf, and log on the planet,  
this poem never ends -- where the line stops, the universe expands.
