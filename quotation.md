# Quotation

Already I’ve made a marriage of disaffectations,  
and now pretend to make of them an art.

No ears to hear said: Such betrayal knows no limits, but for keeping secret.  
No eyes to read written: How this one makes of ashes and ill-repute his fashion.

O what courage one must need, O what grief, O poor me.  
Such love of made madness, confusions and made shame.

Old Mr. Gloom-and-Doom they said, and were cursed.  
But, it’s not *un*true, said the oracle, ironic of all things but irony.

Said a poet: *Life, friends, is boring …*  
but for how long?
