# Hadith

Where do fools part from hope? If one person sets out a tender fig in deep winter,  
and another as the world burns, who waits for them?

Were we raised, rather, for the end of things and not the beginnings?

The path from the barn to the garden might have been a mile  
that we wheeled manure to feed next year’s crop of potatoes and corn.

Though in the bones of my hands, I can feel a trace --  
the weight of the muck giving shape to a frame --  
gone now, where it began and where it ends.

(Like the bees caught in my mother’s hair.)

If I wake or if I sleep.  
If, with a can of petrol and a match, the earth  
sits in despair at the feet of power or if the governs lose the pole.  
If there is weeping, what is this?

Last year, winter burned it down to an ankle.  
This year, it is green.
