# Revolution

Does anyone remember how forgetting works?  
Yesterday I thought about what might happen today.  
I’m pretty sure I was wrong.

Tomorrow I’ll try to think about my dad--he’d be taking the contrary position,  
perhaps on whether children need “education.”  
What he is trying to teach me is: he is, as they say, a person.

At my feet in the back pasture of the farm, I see the rim of a spent shotgun shell,  
Someone ten years back had been hunting rabbits, I’d guess,  
And left this here as an endstop to a future argument.

Did I intend to pick it up?

I can’t look this in the eye or maybe I never could.  
A while back, I made a list of where I’d be ten years from then --  
sometimes I go there just to see how things are turning out.

The man who lives in that house at the end of a long drive has no face.  
He is like a husk of a soul that never was.  
I want to say it’s grim, but it’s not.

What would my dad say about this? I hold the lantern still and can feel the hunger  
start it’s cramp on my gut as he hand milks our only cow --  
he goes on, maybe about bible-olatry or the exploits of the long gone Brooklyn Dodgers.

At a flip of a switch it is 1982 and the radio preacher explains God’s thoughts  
on a “right ot life” as we toss powdered lime into the muck  
where the mare, barren this year, stomps all night in her own piss.

Sounds about right.

But what I was thinking about was today.  
And this city is a long way from memory  
and memory is yesterday and here.

I do not know this person I live with. He seems out of sorts, a crank --  
he’d write something here, at the end, that’s profound  
but that too would be out of line.
