# Sobriety

Peace? Who can talk of poetry without murder?  
Face it: the lungs hover near the heart: the cherished

seraphim await the Holy one: ‘fess up.  
Shotgun or hyssop, what isn’t blood-splattered,

isn’t clean. Disowning that spasm’s matter is war: a pretense  
of mind, a dry-born myth of a day free of slaughter.

Go ahead, step outside this flesh-tent of skins, look:  
every star gathers to a glad banquet of shrapnel and grief.

Ghalib: under the sun-cut sky, suffering is a gash-wound of abundance.  
Forgo your vows and get sloppy drunk: every day, the sweet little knives.
