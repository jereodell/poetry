Braconid cocoons, whiter than apple blossoms against the hornworm's green body,  
emerge from the foliage and with this, the eating and eaten, our bodies all.

Somehow it eases the ache of living and dying too,  
this appearance in the garden, fruit of fruit of.

Dissolution of the one into the many and of the many  
each one destined to dissolve. I leave

them to their harvest, worm, larvae, and wasp, and  
return to my own -- a tomato as big as my hand

to become some small part of my flesh and kind,  
bone and wing, water, root and air.
