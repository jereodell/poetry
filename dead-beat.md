# Dead Beat

Would a prophet come to recall my mother's dreams,  
I should duck my head and run for the cover of sunrise.

The man in the shadows lurks to rip her from sleep  
and we, her children, are drawn from the bedrock of insomnia.

Hear a grandfather's honky-tonk charisma shuffle off;  
hear his holy dumb-struck spirit, his harmonica train

blow through the quarries--the old fool is gone,  
though yet his absence rattles the hollows of my skull.

And of my mother, Belteshazzar beware! She wields a hammer,  
she meets the dragon with a belt--but it's the ache that kills.
