#Retelling

Creek bed of a depth to discard a rusted fridge
or to have lost the carcass of an old cow

and the stream, yet clear, stumbles over goose egg quartz
and Missouri sands. Banks of sycamore and poplar

lean out, trunks water-hollowed, current ankle deep
and bending the length of the pasture, south and west.

Even, an early litter of fall leaves. True story.
Future memory. My myth. Having toddled off

after the family dog, I am born of this waterway under an indifferent cloudscape,
this silent film, this blue iris of revision is of no one & no fool's home; not even my own.
