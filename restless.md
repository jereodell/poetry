# Restless
 
When the mountains are of a shrug rolled up,  
the lacewings of the last wind's shutter and drift,
 
careful then of who'd have all sorrows to his own bend.  
When the sea yens to glass and the clatter of crowns,
 
when to one vision the creatures unending bind,  
careful then who'd have his heaven break and bow.
 
And here, soul ware of the little lines, the feint transgressions,  
dear readers of another tribe, soothsayers, scribes, see:
 
what did it write, a weak boast? This dree and dole,  
a false note from a false time. Who'd carry on, carry on.
