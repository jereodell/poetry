# Indenture

Ghalib goes to her garden, but will not sing—  
goes to her orchard-nest, but can not fly.

Goes to her tent, finds these lines unread.  
Still now, caged, he will not—why should he cry?

Writes: _Who gives another his heart, gives of one  
muscle the tongue—silence now in Babylon, silence in Zion._

What love is this? What she gives, she takes—passionate wrath.  
Better to burn outright all belongings, home and bed.

Would she turn away, still hers his pulse, his breath.  
Ghalib, her nothing, keeps to the garden, why should he sing?
