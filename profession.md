# Profession

When I pay to have my diddling verses put in her hand,  
the delivery boy ends as my rival -- but what is there to say?

This short life makes him a suitor;  
will he, now, return with her answer?

Death too will not listen; the day I have complaints,  
she is nowhere to be found -- but what is there to say?

Too soon or too late, she keeps her own time;  
the monosyllables tick by, the streets of an empty mind.

What more can I say? Ghalib, he too professes a madness,  
as if to spare us this shame, as if (unwound) we are fools at sport.
