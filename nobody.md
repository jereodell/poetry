# Nobody

Simply deceived, we know this one wisdom:  
the unshrinking self -- & do we sing,
 
mire a-croaking full of our somebody songs?  
And yet, here I've been of the worst of readers,
 
heaving it back up, luke warm, this slurry,  
this weak churn of borrowed words.
 
First begging the saint and then robbing the corpse:  
Is this your family or mine sitting subject to these poems?
 
Oh Ghalib! I'll have this one voice and these voices passing time,  
and this display and that every last jot of oblivion.
