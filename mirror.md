# Mirror

Nothing to see here. Move along.  
Everything as old as the sun and the sun  
every jot new every instant.

No, stop, right there.  
There’s too much to take in -- the heart pumps a universe  
and every breath moves multitudes.

The girl I met in my teens, then is now.  
My lost mother’s face found in my own; my wife’s father’s in hers,  
there in the mirror wrapping a head of washed hair in a towel.

I put my hands to the bare earth, when I can,  
between my palms and the dirt, some days I can feel  
the whole rush crash in collapse and explode again.
