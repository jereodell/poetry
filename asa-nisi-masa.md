# *Asa Nisi Masa*

Here we are again at the cramped kitchen table,  
each of one mood and of an age.  
The oven holds a deep pot of chicken cooked in milk  
and there’s not a clean plate in the house.  
The air is thicker than a curse and  
FUCK YOU TOO … and everything you’ve ever done.

I think you’d know what I mean.  
Somewhere in your scriptures you’d find the verses  
to cite another fist of cumin and thyme.  
And we’d sit here, feet up on the board, and glower.

Faces fade.

What I’ve lost is not my love for you, but all that you kept,  
not by intention, but of course,  
and what I have is all that I had,  
this soup of our soul … thins.  

Should we meet again?  
Should … we … meet … again.
