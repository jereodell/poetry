# Geranos
 
Bristled in bird sense, warlike of one mind,  
the cranes arrived in a loose phalanx.
 
And we were certain of our demise. And we  
were fissures, fault lines more so than home,
 
who cowered once beneath the gum trees,  
who carried our tiny shades over shallows.
 
Downward oblivion, we bent low, wait, napes  
bare, knees under chin in, of a sudden, unstudied
 
purpose: bring in the hack, for the blood rush of life, quiet  
the last plea, Beloved â€¦. Eye now, leathers, scissored lance.
