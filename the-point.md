# The Point

Midway gone, this now inevitable -- make a wish:  
That my dreams be inscribed in a script endemic to their land.

Not a loss of direction -- straight as an arrow -- the phrase belies the sag;  
careful then of the attributions of the mighty,

careful then of the qualities, the earnings of merit.  
One life begins and ends in a hive of mixed intentions -- target short; true no more than false.

On the ashy rim of the spent fire pit, summer's last lizard skirts for ants, burnished and cinnabar;  
not a loss for direction -- the spark, action's potential,

armor, nerve & nail -- spry huntsman of this domain.  
I am taken of his eye.
