# The Poets

Then, when everyone seemed justly reputed  
of stature, he pleaded (before his time):

give me a book of signs, an assemblage  
bent to meaning, a sort of revelation --

if even from triage, I will go from here in peace  
and carry the bleat & hiss to a place far away.

Child, she replied, what is this that you covet?  
The poets would drag a train of mistaken disciples.

Ghalib, too, preaches what he will not practice.  
Careful, then, of who'd have heaven itself break & bow.
