# Plot

Half a world away and high above the sea, a thief uprooted a tuber  
and pounded it to a pulp to scent a boudoir he'd never see --

and a dinner that'd spawn two-thousand years of gossip he'd never hear.  
Instead, he took his staff and bag to forage by moonlight in other fields.

What he heard was the long curse of the earth, peopled over  
in trades and traitors. What he saw was the soil of all proverbs,

plants dropping fruit in fallow ground, abundance  
rushing to an end. No light, no late realization, no word of conviction then.

Let him be. You and me. Here, there, these fibers pass, rumen or skein,  
and held in the hand, what good is it to search such ends?
