# Contra Pimpsophist

     >*--for Al*

Mist tent streetlamp question:  
Will wisdom take her honorarium?

Yes—or imagine how it miffs the faculty senate,  
the day Lady Diotima admits this entourage

of madmen, flute-girls, potheads and thieves.  
Friend, one year by and I’ll claim no profession

beyond the Greek chicken at Nick’s  
& after, again to tender our beggars’ questions.

Walking midwinter the drear city night and rain —  
come Love, if even to curse our time, find us there and blessed.
