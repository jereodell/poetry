# Nerve

Grief is; possessed is; mean, more of madness, less of  
lyric luv -- all gibberish is; even our ill-repute. Sub-verse:

obeisance made of habit is; acquiesce is; forget  
who held the razor's edge to save our necks --

or presupposed the dumb cane to wave the drip.  
Same begged off the seven-fired furnace for this

life in flint, one dull embered ache: knuckle bone, throat and eye.  
"Lemman," she gaffs, "spare us your briared miles of nerve,

your stuttered preach, lip and strain, your fireflied mind."  
Main line: *See, we touch and in another country, people die*.
