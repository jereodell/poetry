# Illusions

Eyes clam-shut on madness; of all things,  
the colors rush in, whirl and flash, night

nor kaleidoscope; neitherâ€”visions in the static.  
Headliners loose. Lost. Yank up the sheets

and despair, feigning artistry, poses against revision, reads:  
Would that her face had lit up the mountain to spare us.

What now, but the tracings? Lace work, capillaries  
reclaiming time, a youth gaming light or playing blind?

Ghalib, Mandelstam, Davie: *The child, though, sleeps. The vast  
universe sleeps, where cradled Eternity watches.*
