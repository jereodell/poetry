# Cut

Given a fine bird of great tropical beauty,  
she finds the talon, the claw, and bone-hooked beak.

Given the whole book of song, the mind of art,  
an ancient kingdom writ from myth to material,

and she scoffs: your cherished word is too an idol.  
So, she mires the winepress and throws herself against the goad.

But who am I, possessing nothing of right to give,  
who'd bring again the healers to dress lightly a mortal cut,

who'd name her his daughter, who'd choose her his own,  
who pays the mourners now to weep, a raw fool's fist.
