# Monument

Ash for wick, this one candle to mark my age  
& the scars I carry, these burned-out bits, wishes lost.

And yet, once more, I pause to open the mirrored door  
above my father's sink & recount his personal effects;

find the disposal cut in the back wall of the medicine cabinet  
and imagine a dust heap of paper strips, bottle caps and razor blades,

dropped there in a slipping monument of the mundane.  
(Fidelity admits no decorum & demands a bruising wage.)

Would my child, my adversary, someday my reader, come here  
to this chest of oddities, of bitter parsings, love give us ease.
