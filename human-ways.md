# Human Ways

After passing the halfway mark of my life, I started removing books  
from the shelves of the house. Why did I collect all of these?  
Asks the librarian of his younger ambitions.

If one will answer, the other will not bear to listen.

I remember a year when an open buffet of potato chips and onion dip  
seemed to be a great find, saving a night’s budget for a meal,  
filling to a feeling of unsated bloat.  
It was opportunity and not design that measured those days.

Now, too, I guess -- or rather, design is lost to some kind of ache,  
some sort of battle with regret and thinking of lost ends.

The less I eat now, the better my days  
and a spread of chips and dip is as much as poison.  
Months go by without a morsel of fried food and I’m none the lighter for it.

Meanwhile, my children have aged into their own anxieties,  
the press and crush, the uncertainty of what comes next,  
the singularity of everything. What can be said?  
But nothing.

The little green bird, a black-capped conure, that kept time in our lives  
and announced the morning news, the school bus, and all arrivals,  
died one night in the pandemic, emptied of twenty years.

I took him outside and dug a whole near a rose bush, dropped him in  
wrapped in a t-shirt, back-filled, and placed a large limestone on top  
to keep anything from digging him up.

It was a familiar ritual. In my first decade I had already buried  
the cats that ran out of luck crossing the road.

I didn’t cry, but added this feathered ache to a swell  
in my ribs and tendons. The elders may refuse  
to give us a map and if I am to be, I too decline.

I boxed up another shelf of books and dropped them off at Goodwill --  
all the labor in those pages, the carefully said, the years of research,  
the fact checking, the editorial disputes .. and why did anyone write?  
There are surer ways to make pay  
and, all the same, we said what we said.

The lake in Kentucky that I visit sometimes in my sleep, I last saw  
more than thirty years ago and seventy years before that,  
it didn’t exist. Some day it will wash away the earthen wall  
holding it back and spill into the river it once was.

At last, let it all be undone.
