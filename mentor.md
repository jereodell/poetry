# Mentor

My teacher, the last aging father in my life, appeared in the halls  
of learning. We did not speak, but someone from his entourage

chattered as he chose our seats. Together, we guessed  
the man’s age. Was it 80?

We’re slipping away -- the whole lot of us, who  
count in lives passed.

Yesterday, at the start of summer, a cat hurried a chipmunk  
from the neighbor’s yard and pinned it beneath a parked car.

But an arms’ length away and unfazed, two squirrels  
tore after each other in tight circles as,

like some ancient, lumbering beast, heavy with what he calls “mind,”  
I plodded by.

This is not what he’d want, my teacher -- there at his latest podium,  
ruffling through his life’s poems and wondering where it all began.

But what would he want? Maybe, I think, the days  
I walked by his door and didn’t stop to say “hi.”

Or maybe that I’d write something less grim
and for once, just let it fly.

Or, for God’s sake, be content  
that we’re old enough to think it matters and too young to know why
