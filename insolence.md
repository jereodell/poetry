# Insolence

Bite my tongue and the pain too sings between the teeth.  
Should I stop to breathe, the marrow too finds the quick.

Lord knows, there's no temperance in religion -- now she  
turns my child too, who blushes him redoubtable, we now

stutter us one, we who'd be so lucky -- yes,  
to envy ourselves, who'd dare take in her gaze,

flare. Call it flame, call it sun, this viral desire:  
my histic soul and heat, such an impish reach, this.

This too, the very longing is too much -- much like smoke  
from the fire, how my shadow would flee the bloody temple.
