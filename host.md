One’s premonition is another’s adversity -- let’s say, an owl,  
chased from its haunt, alights at the window ledge  
of a four-storied, glass office space.

What does it mean? It is almost the middle of February  
and we have had only one snowfall of any substance.

What happens next? A year of drought or flood or fire or bloody revolt?  
Maybe Russia has gathered its troops at the border while a world  
of diplomats scurry to find the remaining chants of their vocation.

I think, somewhere, maybe the north corner of the roof,  
a raccoon and her kits have found their way into the house.  
At night they clatter through the attic’s castaways;  
by daybreak, they settle into a pocket of blown insulation …and wait.
