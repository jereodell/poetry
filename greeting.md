# Greeting

What would any fool hope to understand?  
Having pushed this carcass its final inch

upwards to the sun, age comes heaving down.  
What then becomes of this lust

for revelation? See â€“ the sky in its span,  
lips and insteps, curves to kiss the seashores,

or (arched-over backwards, torso skin-taut,  
ribbed) bends above the great peaked mountains.

My love, what greeting is this? Who'd dare read  
this dire bed, this pained creation, these vaulted heavens?
