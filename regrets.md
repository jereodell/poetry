# Regrets

For what it's worth, what we lost in intemperance,  
the age, wasn't much -- brief days spread thin.

And then, what chance did we have to flee? Our own youth  
lay in the pit at our doorstep & aspiration hurried us in.

Now, we too are her wards, who'd once ask for news,  
who'd ply our words & fancy ourselves to suit,

who'd made in grief the whole portion, meat & bone,  
who'd plaint now for poems: nubs and blotter.

Friend! Confess. Say: the day we took up beggingâ€”it was all in good fun,  
and now, suppose, at long last, the waiting too was in jest.
