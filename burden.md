# Burden

At last, who'd dare read this story built and vaulted  
as of the heavens? Some pained creation from a dire bed

of regrets? The pasture slid grass over lime-  
stone, bits of shell, fossil and shelf --

step-wise, hoof and cattle trail. Follow  
this? Troop founded in myth

pounding down in gravel and grit, this family sod.  
Enough. Call out the waters of the sea

that once poured over this nameless place.  
Face it. Have now who cares or who carries.
