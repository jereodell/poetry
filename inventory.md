>*— ghazal rhyming with lines from John Peck’s “A Stock Taking”*

*Its whole delight is in birth,* the soul’s happiness.  
But she’s so alluring, Death. And no swifter

governess, black silk and cigarette, midwifes the wider  
crossings. Here, this cat-willow skiff lulls in quilted space,

a dreamed sea; one breath, the only wind for a lifetime of travel —-  
the only wave, this one pulse in the veins. Where’s the entire

mountain of song now? Where’s all hope, but gravel for Baal’s builders?  
Come, Sinai, how long will you leave me to Pharaoh’s moods?

*Suitor, what’s all this emptiness? Give to vacancy  
or go brawl at Café des Poètes. Wade the waters of change.*
