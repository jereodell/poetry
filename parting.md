#Parting

The country weep -- focus, the eyes lose track, recess  
and the mind bends to the backyard garden,  

imprinted of kinds of hope, an ill-match for words,
the touch, the heart's pace and shift of her breath,  

a scent I can't name, so forgotten, non-memorial,
loam, fold, coax & mound, carrots blade to a feather,  

non-confessional, but confessed (no one reads this)  
to make manifest our positions, to write, write, and write,  

to hold and make our stand, to lie in our bed of principles  
so given of a kind and of kin -- it is a traitor.
