# Writers Are Jerks

Somewhere, maybe halfway through their works,  
all authors, the “great” ones anyway,  
prove that they are jerks.

For example, what did Cervantes not do to torture his knight?  
And Dante? All of heaven and hell spins around the center of his selfies.

(The lesser authors are jerks too, I suppose, but fail.)

Closer to home, take Berryman -- for all his sins --  
he would not get over himself and waved bon voyage to his students  
in one last lurch off the bridge.

The philosophers too -- dear Gramsci, bless you,  
but whatever did you mean to prove to the illiterate?

Who have I left out? Oh, yes, the women.  
And God, also.

If I were a better writer I’d have plenty of mean things to say about them too,  
from Alcott and Angelou to Oates, Oliver, and Omega,  
but this poem doesn’t hold together.

(I mean, me too? ... Am I sure I could do worse but not better?)
