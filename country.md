# Country

With a crease in the voice a songster bewails  
the passing of the family farm; decades gone,

the body becomes its hours  
hunched over the keyboard and screen. Gone

the late February afternoons, gray wet and mud,  
the horses crowding the gate, eager

for dry bedding, a bucket of grainâ€”but thoughts  
silt to the office carpet, a residue of a dull hunger,

fluorescent fed but of leeching hints, feint urges (watchful  
of predator, sharp of prey) altogether unremarkable & retiring.
