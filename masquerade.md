# Masquerade

No one sees her -- or she turns to the mountain  
and the mountain slips, billows down in dust.

So, now -- Sinai, those forty days and nights, those forty thousand years,  
lost -- or searching for some mirage, the prophets wander …

And I too am her fool -- but crowing this feigned devotion,  
praying, mostly, that I'd forget my shame, still: would she turn …

Lord, end this masquerade, blaze & hurry me from this place --  
or, sweep me (dry shell of a wasp) from this sanctuary.

Hear us then sing your mercies in the byways of ruin.  
Ghalib: Poet, too long -- I too, her messenger, tire of this moan.
