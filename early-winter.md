# Early Winter

Freeze and thaw, freeze and thaw -- early winter,  
and the cauliflower leaves layout in blue tones for the sun.

Fruitless now for nearly a month, their snow white hearts cut out  
and their arms left for greens. All a year's garden in this --

plague I'd only known in books, loss I've assumed to know so well,  
estranged of all, resigned of position, homed in transgression.
 
My mother's wedding photo, framed, looks out over the stairs.  
What would I see in her face if I had never known her?

But keep our gardens and the small creatures under foot, this the soil  
and the bent over ache, hallowed or hollowed, sour or sore, our dust of return.
