# Husbandry

Somewhere in the dead of night a creature rummaged  
through the seedlings I had planted in the winter basement.

It left no trace, but stems snipped of leaves  
and a few of the newest shoots of cilantro uprooted in their bins.

Iâ€™ve guessed it to be a mouse and have left bait and traps with no result --  
and so, I will suppose it something fantastical,  
a mighty little gardener housed in the brickwork of the walls.

What she must think of me, if she does.

Suppose she sleeps by day, tucked away dreaming to wake to a world of stays,  
where what is planted, there goes to seed and waits a gentle tend --  
and not this, the churn and remains.
