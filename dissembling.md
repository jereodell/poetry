# Dissembling

Fissures and fault lines more so than home,  
and I have moved to equal the gut string

of an old guitar and here, again, these lost  
relations have followed us, who fret and hum.

Inheritance: light burns, sound sears; what  
are these disparate loyalties, ill-kept, trip-wired?

Dissembling, the prophet insists: I am just a boy!  
(To be in exile is to name a place your own.)

But we, long since, forgotten; but we went so far as to:  
pluck and break, destroy and overthrow, and nothing more.
