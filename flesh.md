# Flesh
 
2 a.m. March migraine, hours contract in spectral waves of white and I  
am 30 years with one lover, her present skin

and the memory of it rises above the strain. Ah ha!  
Listen, the tomatoes sprout under lights -- green spindles from paper seeds,

and time is, the whole stock is, the living mass too  
creaturely -- more than half dying. The animal

body, curse upon curse & fail upon failure, still to reach  
an age to leave lament to the young.

Equatorial, this one alignment across all creation.  
And again and again. Praise in madness & her skin!
