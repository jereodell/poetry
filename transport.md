At the end of the world, no one reads this poem.  
And the prophets fall silent -- or the false ones blather on.

And why would I write another word of this?  
But what have we here? In a mulched landscape the yellow loosestrife

lands and takes root and blooms its bit of wild hope  
while all around, nothing sets seed and the sidewalk bakes.

Neither despair nor a final end to all things,  
nor a triumph against all odds --

alone, the organism in a place and time, owning nothing;  
or, come quickly now, would our debts were not ours to pay?
