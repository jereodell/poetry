# Doom and Gloom
 
The prophets stand alone and in madness, some  
prattle on: what befell the gold standard,
 
the richest man in Belize, and in which moon  
rides the great whore of Babylon.
 
But revelation, like the end of the world,  
surfaces to the maggot, the hook and the cat gut.
 
_As with a message pressed into your hand, that is  
to have an answer by return, at once,_
 
it rises, pre-memorial, in a silent fog & its bearer,  
carp-faced, knows so little of what to say.
