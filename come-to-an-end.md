# Come to an End

You have known me, but that first fuck -- Lord, he was praying  
like Jesus: I’ve no luck, nor can I turn from your kisses.

How could one, the kisses of her mouth? Shame  
then only the breath of redundancy, pudendum, worm, and . . .

I’d die to believe I’m her love, but how? These veins  
of sediment, this flesh packed in lime, what’s to bleed?

For God’s sake, anguish would be living! How strange the saying:  
One cannot serve two masters -- as if there were another.

*Measure up, Love, besides when did you get religion?  
And what’s all this gushing for? This artless swoon.*
