# Passage

Who made the world a child's playground?  
Day and night, only so much to see -- the conquests of history,

even Solomon's throne seems a play thing,  
and the Second Coming, a secret passage.

Ordinary? Where then does conversation become conversion?  
Friend, bring the bottle -- together we'll measure our portions.

The rituals of the faithful amass on all sides  
and the recitation compels a poet's impiety.

Last, even after the hands refuse to write,  
breathing, the lungs ease into rhyme.
