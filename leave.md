# Leave

Ancient in our errors,  
and in our murderous virtues too;

set apart in a little town, kept aside,  
a people of a lonely confession, an old saw

honed to a fine ribbon, teeth  
for a millstone and a song, flesh to sear, swell.

Old bones, chalk and seed set on edge.  
Child, go; plead some dearer neighbor of ours:

make the corrections, about this and any vista.  
Shake me off, swear and curse, have your leave.
