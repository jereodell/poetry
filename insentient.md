# Insentient

A lone crane wings into a scape of little lights,  
straight by night. Hardened and sore. Indifferent and decided.

Strip mall parking lots. Discount tobacco. Check-into-cash. Gold’s  
or God’s workout gym and palace. (Who even cares anymore?)

Sentiment long since given its way, insentient.  
Course long since given away, consigned.

Oblivious of decline, white necked and wary, she lands  
in the snow-crusted scar of harvest, neither messenger nor omen.

Creature neither of industry nor of sign,  
she strides over the blasted soil one last time.
