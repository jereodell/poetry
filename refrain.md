# Refrain

I.

Blackbird (thrush, not a starling) and nightingale (thrush, not a swift) though invasive of art are less common in fact. The songs of this place are more raucous -- raw days and nights before the end times.

Walking home, nights and evenings, she whistled her favorite hymns or at least the ones she knew. What the neighbors thought or who followed her to the little house (the power out, the food running low), no one knows ... anymore. And fear? Oh yes, sure. She was young and this was long before the end times.

->~<-

Summer road trips through Arkansas in the 80s would be trying for any young family -- row after row of soybeans, cotton fields gone to rice, rice gone to catfish. And then, amid long stretches of new growth pine and the stench of paper mills, the radio would go all to fuzz. Here and there, in and out of range, chipped and mummed: “Brothers … the end of times.”

->~<-

Sing a song? Yes, I’m the crow that eats among eagles. I’ll pull a tail feather. Fuck your COVID. I don’t wear a mask. I’m a noser in your halls to the end of times.

->~<-

What people say at your funeral, no one knows. Do they put you in your Sunday dress? If they sing, do they remember the words to the song? Does the preacher trot out his tripe about the end of times?

II.

The morning the sky turned green and the rivers filled the streets, automobiles bumped and jettied this way and that; half submerged, a billboard read: “Are you ready for the end times?”

->~<-

At harvest she discovered to her chagrin that someone has seeded the garlic upside down. Had she made such a blunder or, sign of all signs, was this the end of times?

->~<-

The cattle gate would sit in the mud of March and the horses would crowd there waiting for feed. Knee deep in muck, he’d turn to the east and point at a rainbow: “Look at that! … How we know it’ll be fire next and not a flood at the end of time.”

III.

The day of the inauguration began on a high note; though, by many accounts, it was the first day of the end times.

->~<-

Where does the light go? All those stars flaming out less than a billion years ago. Puff and they’re gone? Or shining on ever into the void at the end of times?

IV.

It’s less an irony and more a matter of course that many things *true* require as much time outside of time than in, but even this has a beginning -- see “The Quartet for the End of Time.”

V.

First thing was his password wouldn’t work. Next thing was: no updates! Surely this was the end times.

->~<-

It seemed no one had been to visit his apartment for at least a decade and now that he was gone, she was there picking through a lifetime of “personal effects.” I mean, what was he keeping all this stuff for? Every letter he’d received, envelopes and stamps. Newspapers from 1969. A folder of Thoroughbreds from a stud barn. A photo of a horse named: “The End Times” ….

VI.

I crawled out of the ditch (such as it was, chest deep and dark) and clawed my way up the levee a stone shelf. There in the monochrome between memory and dreams, I assumed it was my mother’s face. Lost and yet enduring, more so than I, and this and these and the end of times.

->~<-

On her way to keep the goats, an Afghan child saw the first Soviet tank lurch across the valley; it was the end of times.

->~<-

How long had it been since he last stood on lake ice -- feet deep and splintered in solid glass, a creature of its own, groaning from the depths of a song as unto the end of times?

VII.

You think this is hard, but division is what comes at the end of times

->~<-

Brothers, you will be glad to know that this was, as many will testify, the best revival the church had ever hosted. People came from all over central Kentucky and it was standing room only -- even the balcony was full. Maybe this was a turning point for our little town. Clearly many were moved by the preacher’s message and hungry to learn more about the end times.

->~<-

Is it faith or foolishness that something so fleeting as a rainbow would be a promise to carry from one flood to the end of time?

->~<-

Darkness does move, blackest volcanic rock, edge of knife, roiling in its heart of lava. No, it is the light that is still, its glare and eye, its unsparing of all, running out the end of time.

VIII.

No matter how much they tried, the farm’s one gilding would not be kept from cribbing. The top boards of his fence, painted in creosote, were gnawed to half moons; the stall where he was put up, was bored to cheese. At last, he was pastured in barbed wire and brush, but he might have been the first to know: this was the end of times.

->~<-

For some interventions a physician must reach back into the history of medical care and practice. For example, it seems, leeches will have a place in medicine until the end of times.

->~<-

What is it with humans? This fixation on the undoing of everything they know. This kink, this grand sublimation of the flesh; this shiver in the spine and there it goes -- all in from a fear to a longing for the end times.

->~<-

I wake up and sit on the edge of my bed and wait. This first step of my day near as uncertain as the first step of my life. What will it bring, some new pains of an aging body? If I make it across the room to the mirror, I’ll see there the remnants of my mother’s face, calling to me for the end of time.

->~<-

What religion is: making an end of its beginning, finding in this minute of flesh a sign, a hymn enduring the end of time.
