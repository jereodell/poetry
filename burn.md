# Burn

The flea beetles have grown full eggplant  
and the aphids feed

the ants up a long stemmed cosmos,  
little jewels of rock candy in the wind, sticky sweet  
viridian -- summer is of an age to let itself go.

Go on then.  
Yes, you.  
(I’ll say I didn’t hear that. What now, what now ... )

A crop of squirrel kits have come down from the trees,  
fully formed, marking the shortest path  
from fence to trunk, branch to wire.

The vibration of a single hair sings  
an uncertain time, like a  
certainty -- now.  
No, now.

The flea beetles, the birth of all things  
or even just a few, I mean.

Mean tatters, bitten, weathered, loaded up in  
waiting a burn

I put the tiniest of ants on the tip of my tongue --  

O, my last of little loves.
