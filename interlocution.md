# Interlocution

Sidewalks and porkchop bones, these human facts --  
one to crush the heal, the other to stave off the wild.  
The concrete, to show us where to walk; the chop, a cut  
to hide what we eat.

(Your problem is: no one knows what you're talking about --  
and even fewer give a damn.)

Anthropo-scenary. I stood on the barn's clay dirt floor,  
a boy, and watched blood drip into gloppy rivulets  
from the steer's carcus, hooked, chained, and hoisted, strung up.  
My family's meat (or half of it) for a season.  
I had bottle-fed this animal when he was a calf  
and I was not grieved, nor shamed, nor at peace.  
Is it too much to say I stood on holy ground?

(Here we go, Jeebus!)

Birth, life, death and butchering. And all for forgetting,  
or not.

(Hey farmboy! This aint the Waltons.)

Food then was sweeter.

(Nostalgia! and false. What's more? Go on, go on.)

Very well. But it's all gone now.  
A childhood rooted in a plaything of a farm --  
shallow soil, short, short days. What's left now,  
but city sidewalks and the garbage a raccoon strew about.

(Oh, for fuck's sake.)
