# Curse

Shadow of the man who fled his daughter,  
hid in the darker corners of her dreams --

shade of the father, thin over four hundred miles  
of lime, dishonorable in the mind, absence,

of you too, I make my claim.  
In the far away land of Desolation a lone hyena

paws through a gone seasonâ€™s kill -- bleach,  
tooth and bone, hollowed up, cinched in the flanks.

Here, an ostrich neither runs nor ducks its head,  
but wastes to a feather and, O for a breeze, to at last take flight.
