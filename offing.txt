Offing

A lone crow drawn to snow melt on tar paper
tracks the winter sun across the patio roof.

His is the black sheen of certainty; his the knack
of society, of necessity; his the seasons.

Squatter here, behind the window pane,
given to possess, owning fictions ours,

I am hiding a flesh, nude to the heavy bone.
But would hunger row among the wind, beyond

the fir and pine, out over this earth's curve,
then, there, would no other murder be but of our kind?
