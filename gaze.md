# Gaze

Taking in – loneliness, the vacuum – a mixed fare  
of public faces at the counter, in the park,

in the waiting rooms of mortality: each  
its own map of the unspoken lost, awaited.

Flesh, her check turns to the gaze, criss-crossed  
in the deep weave; flesh, the role of fat at his nape:

in this, the crease, the valley of the living.  
*People everywhere, time and the work pauseless.*

And this too moves between reading and re-reading,  
the one shape drawn to a stillness unexplained.
