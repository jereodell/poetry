# Foreclosure
 
Standing in the gravel alley, gazing back at the ache  
of the house we had left, hollow there in its ragged yard,
 
clearly then, the decade had passed & the grape vine,  
now, weighing down the single stake I had planted it by,
 
would make no memorial, nor will this, this stuttering page,  
admit in honesty, here, in what youth it was, I too threw those stones,
 
scatter-shod at the madmen of sentiment I have become.  
Hurry now, I feel them & from the childâ€™s arm, hurtling home.
 
Quick, shut it down, this door, this book, this blade,  
or bring them thudding, one by one, to this & each dismembered bone.
