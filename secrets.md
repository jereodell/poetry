# Secrets

This affair has made me the fool and I carry on.  
What is shame without self regard? What is self?

Self pawned his books and hocked his mind for booze.  
Self forgets how long it was he last drank to cheer.

Self picks and tatters his prayer shirt and rug.  
Were Self so lucky, were Self anointed to question,

to beg of the earth her many corpses, Self would plead:  
Love, what have you made of these treasures?

Ghalib? She came to him too (with all her secrets, with her learned embraces)  
and pleaded forgetfulness, that, even so, she kept her promises.
