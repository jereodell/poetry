Years past a morning at the Keeneland training oval,  
what might have been an heirloom of kind, of fathers and sons,

recedes to a constant forgetting. The jockey breezes the colt  
through the far turn as we cross to the infield, where:

Sound the alarm! A pair of wood ducks flees the pond,  
leaving the faintest wake and Doppler trace to bend

over a furlong of track -- there, the hoof and shoe fades  
in a minute of sand; here, who now am I making this,

as if a passing light would serve for fact, our share in the alchemy  
of the mind, half-kept, but echo, spare us, flash and stay.
