# Rival

Foot dragging the plaza, complaint pinched  
between finger and thumb, my rival

stoops and writes her name for all to see  
on light poles and curbstones, begs

man and dog for her requital. I'd worry,  
but I too recoil from her touch, her blade rich generosity.

Embers among ash, her laughter evokes certain  mortalities and besides, what is love to command?

Between us, Ghalib (or his angel) minds a vast curtain,  
itself a kind of fire and a yearning to lift.
