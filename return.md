# Return

Unheard auguries of feather and palm, the finesse of brocade,
what is to be gained in this display? Let’s put this hobby aside.

Only a fool sings without offense, an encomium to folly
the court painter knew too well to apply. Observe:

Is this your family or mine sitting subject to our poems,
Elsbeth Bizenstock Schmidt Holbein and children.

Manifesto, when what angelic fancy breezes up one
time to back smack down on this holy ground:

Flesh before aesthetics! And yet, ask the tanner’s widow:
Dear Lady, when is Ioannes to return to Basel?
