# Greetings
 
Greet, greet, Oahu, and for how long,  
your most common bird, the tiny white eye.
 
Our invasive husbandry bearing its wreck,  
its urgent demise, decades before and after
 
the first torpedoes in the harbor. Greet, greet.  
But break, poet, quit; we have heard enough
 
your vectors of ill verse. Who should so mourn?  
Nursing, from this mighty distance, visions of seasons past?
 
Who for old times keeps the pasture, so builds cities for ruin.  
Be gone with your romance! Greet, greet.
