# Equivalence

These countless desires—ephemera, ingrates of the earth,  
who’d steal off the spirit, who’d exhaust life’s one breath,

who’d quick hush the candles out and leave us here, infirm and unfit,  
look what a company of well-wishers they keep in picture bliss arrayment.

& all the while I’m here in silence, or behind every line, the inaudible chant,  
the dry hand of Holbein writing: “I Dirk Tybis London, 33, had this appearance.”

*Beloved, what’s this*, she croons, *follow to follow and where’s your suitor’s fear?  
Have what will—the boast, the gear, the meat, the yearning for.*

Ah, sweet Moses and his skull, would I brazen such a countenance, she’d obliterate;  
would I say, “Press me into the rock, love”, she’d burn out my face.
