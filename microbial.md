A vast wilderness moves within the body; we
are fed by its grazing, kept by its predations, who

would feign fewer dependencies, less bloody means,
appetites of mind, we who are a universe.

All the same, one morning my child stumbles to the kitchen,
leaner than a reed of Egypt, breath fruity with sugars,

and one must pause—and near the foot,
a grackle picks unnoticed through our leavings.

Eye of hustle, nervous of the sky, needle to the skull—
of his flock, I have not kept watch; flesh, a cat stalks my heart.
