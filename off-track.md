# Off Track

A furlong off the pace and the horse in last  
came to a dead stop, the jockey didn’t seem to care  
and sat and took his right leg out of the stirrup as if to stretch.

The front of the race was gone  
and no one should bother with what happened there --  
one assumes the ordinary liturgy: a whip to the wire, breeze to a walk,  
the levelheaded hands riding out on old geldings to grab the reins,  
the barn, the bath and rubdown,  
and, at last, a stall with a cat.

But no one put money down that these two would be done with all that.  
Horse and rider, retirement forgone,  
nor knocked down, nor petrified, nor wild --  
but here, all the same, though as of another world.

If I’d say I could see them now, it’d be a lie.  
They’re beyond that -- somewhere  
between this poem and the moon (the actual moon), there  
they see the rush of all things pulse by and through,  
without center, direction, or place.  
No where, maybe.

Here we are, though.  
You and I and these words and that line and this.  
How and why you got this far without calling it quits, I don’t know.  
I’d say it’s not too late to drop the bit and graze awhile, but really, I haven’t the mind.
