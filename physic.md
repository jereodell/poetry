#Physic

Like the innocence of cream, smooth but anxious and raw, 
a young woman sits in the cafe with her school notes and coffee.

There, a sad note sounding a quarter-life's distance from meaning. 
But, here, would she visit, at a hand's depth, the rainbow darter rests

anchored in hidden currents, the only tell, pelvic fins shadowing substrate. 
Sign of a world seen and unseen, physic to all oblivion above,

season and rush, highway and hill, industry and harvest, 
industry and the maddening rage. Wait for us, dear creatures

and hope -- what of hope? Of hope lost?
Angel of shimmer and sheen, arrow in the stream, bring us from flight.
