# Entreaty

Tattered of a mournerâ€™s robe, the sun, black sun  
becomes the crown and the crown becomes the king

and the king becomes his hordes; the king, the mighty king,  
he is like a hunter before gods, before the gods

just so he went out upon the desert plains and mountain crests  
and bloody valleys spilt over the seas.

Words upon words, the readers took up swords and the poets,  
ever dissembling, emptied their hermitage of grief.

Words upon words, the wind falls upon its teeth, O majestical march,  
oblivion, I beg you, pass over the seed mouse as she tends her harvest store.
