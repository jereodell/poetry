#Tumult

Our footpaths breaking amid the dunes and the great lake  
awash in gull feathers, snack wrappers and foamâ€”bickering

and young, we were the scorched earth and we were  
in our tumult, besides all this, love's entertained.

Guests of a sort, accusing the quartz, sedge, grit  
in and all teeth, the off-season opuntia needling the loins.

I'll not mourn us then, now. You and I, we brought our lamps  
to this banquet and kept our wicks trim, waited, economized,

made the worst, most earnest plans, who knew not ...  
who, then and now, beloved, made our peace, beg our leisure.
