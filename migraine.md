# Migraine

Run. Straight into the desert blade, full stride & lung;  
chase the sun-cut horizon . . . while, at one speed, see

how, just beyond reach, the auroras warp  
over the sphere & air, lace the temporal cortex.

Run this glare heat & bleed; see her footpaths of sapphire  
and in one fell, how the city spreads oblong, jewel-stoned in

spectral ephemera. Like no Cyrillic ever dreamed, the script  
veins the ceramic skull and the child-king shatters the chalice.

Hildegard! Where have you gone? Who’ll now sweep this trail of glass?  
Run & I’ll bleed, but who’ll dress the wounds on my daughter’s feet?
