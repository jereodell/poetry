Keep

Rage, some kind of dreaming, the maple fruits a wasp.
Her possible border clad in hopeless armor, clamped down

upon more action than potential, every neuron in the crux
and what is left, but some rank soup, some sour mash.

Lid on it, necessity is but proof and curse, mark of the man.
Hold her in and who is I gathers her more to judge

and then, one to mourn. Disbodied. Limp.
Scar, some kind of earning, facing incoherence.

Trickle off, beloved, drip away in the sear; leave madness maddened;
a demoniac gnaws a shin, one grinds the very bone, root and jaw.
