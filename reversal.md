# Reversal

Off. Take the turn cautiously, rightly, wrongly. Exit.  
The silent way a downramp turns; its curve blind, its way, leading.

A ghost of automobiles and semi-tractors litter the berm or  
the choke of sumac, briar and barbed fencing in a crumple

(I have a story about you that is somewhat true.)  
ends a narrative. Walk the way back.

Three spans of life in three lands, later or before. My daughter's crib  
among the wreckage, wood slats, mattress, sheets, toys and dolls,

all of a piece. Ever my elder, ever my minor. What can we say?  
"It was like a bomb went off" said no one in the house where the bomb went off.
